<long_description>Tetris for Wii.
Controls: Hold the wiimote sideways. Use the D-Pad to move pieces, 1 and 2 rotate, A to hold a piece, and B to hard drop. Press + to pause at any time, and Home to quit.
Game Modes:
	- Endless: Survive for as long as you can as the pieces start to fall faster
	- 40 Line Sprint: Clear 40 lines as fast as possible.
	- Score Attack: Earn the highest score within 3 minutes.
	- The One Piece: [NOT IMPLEMENTED YET] Survive for as long as you can using only one random piece shape.
	- Cheese Race: [NOT IMPLEMENTED YET] Clear the garbage lines AKA Swiss Cheese and place a piece at the bottom as fast as possible
	- Tetris Only: Clearing anything less than a tetris results in a game over.
	- Color Blind: [NOT COMPLETE] The pieces are all a random color. -- Shadows are not the same color, and the queued pieces don't look right
	- Invisible: Survive as long as you can without seeing any of the pieces.
	- Lotka-Volterra:[NOT IMPLEMENTED YET] Survive as long as possible. Each level removes a piece shape until only 1 is remaining, then the pieces start coming back and the cycle repeats.
Selecting a game mode that has not been implemented yet defaults the rules to endless mode.
